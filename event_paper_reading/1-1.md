# Paper Title: Event Camera-based Visual Odometry for Dynamic Motion Tracking of a Legged Robot Using Adaptive Time Surface

## Introduction
- How to process the event data?
    - Construct Event image, apply RGB techniques: Not robust to random movements because of camera motion.
    - Directly use event data: Binary event data constructed, make the optmiz difficult to converge smoothly to a correct pose.
    - Time surface, smooth gradients used for pose estimation, but difficult to choose correct decay rate
    - **Adaptive Time Surface:** automatically choose the decay rate. Adaptive to camera motion speed and complexity of the env textures.

- How to detect and maintain distinctive pixels remain significant?
    - Constant threshold pick pixels: too sparse or dense, impede optimization.
    - Direct mehtod don't explicitly detect or track features for key point matching.
    - **Selecting pixels directly from event data and performing filtering based on ATS**
- Combine with depth information
    - construct a map keyframe

Summary: ATS, pixel selection and filtering, simultaneous optimization over RGB and event data.
